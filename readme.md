Hello,

this is a table of safety observations I made while attending welding school.

It can be viewed in your browser @ frankburgs.github.io

# To-do

- Add Print icon top left cell
- Add media="print" to print script. Use !important if difficulties arise.

- Try window.addEventListener("afterprint", () => self.close);
- to reinstate old CSS rules ?

- Standardize how SVG icons are handled.

- Make images an array & update script.

- if type = anecdote make reference Anecdote

- Add "date taken" to fire extinguisher inspection tag images.

- Modify code to not *require* recommendation keyed object.

- Incorporate 93-item Weld safety checklist to program using Adobe OCR.

- Table column sorting functionality.

- First quarter student task matrix.

- Table of consumibles & equipment (msds)

- Mermaid diagram of PPE.

- SVG of standardized booth layout.

- Add functional "add safety observation" option that allows user to create an added table item in their browser.

- ðŸ¦º find legal requirement for signage legibility (or 'condition'). Do search for 'oag'.

- Why even have a light mode ?
